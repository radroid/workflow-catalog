# Blocks log

Structured record of everything the autonomous loop would otherwise halt on: sub-agent block verdicts, peer-review request_changes, smoke failures, contract drift, user-decision blockers, arch-pass results. Blocks keep the loop moving: a block becomes an entry here and the loop picks the next non-conflicting item.

Each entry follows this format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title> [APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES|BLOCK|FAILURE|DRIFT]

**Iter:** NNN
**Source:** peer-review | arch-pass | smoke-failure | mcp-preflight | user-report | contract-drift
**Severity:** low | medium | high

**Charter / context:** <one line>
**Verdict text / failure detail:** <body>

**Action taken:** <main agent's response>

## 2026-09-22 — P00 peer review, round 1 [REQUEST_CHANGES]

**Iter:** 001
**Source:** peer-review
**Severity:** medium

**Charter / context:** Opus reviewer over PR #1 (P00 scaffold); every acceptance command green on a fresh clone.
**Verdict text / failure detail:** VERDICT: REVISE — 2 issues. (1) `scripts/check-fixtures.mjs` skipped tracked files with non-ASCII names (`git ls-files` quoting plus a swallowed ENOENT), so a staged `fixtures/résumé.md` holding a job-board URL and a webmail address passed. (2) `.npmrc` `engine-strict`/`save-exact` are ignored by pnpm 11.17.0, so the Node 24 requirement was not enforced.

**Action taken:** Sent back to the same implementer once. Revision 1 (head 1781f71): `git ls-files -z`, read errors other than ENOENT/EISDIR reported as offenses, a `node --test` regression wired into root `pnpm test`; settings moved to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; also pinned typescript-eslint 8.70.0 (removed the release-age bypass), CI `permissions: contents: read`, commit-pinned screenshot URL.

## 2026-09-22 — P00 peer review, round 2 [APPROVE]

**Iter:** 001
**Source:** peer-review
**Severity:** low

**Charter / context:** Same reviewer, diff b465e84..1781f71, new fresh clone.
**Verdict text / failure detail:** VERDICT: APPROVE. Repro now exits 1 naming the file; engines mismatch fails install; `pnpm add` writes exact versions; no check weakened (the scanner has no path exclusions; the test assembles its disallowed address at runtime).

**Action taken:** Squash-merged PR #1 into overnight/integration as d107806; packet Status: done.

## 2026-09-22 — P00 UI critique [APPROVE]

**Iter:** 001
**Source:** peer-review (UI critic)
**Severity:** low

**Charter / context:** Screenshots at 1280×800 and 390×844 against theme.css and the walkthrough.
**Verdict text / failure detail:** VERDICT: APPROVE. Tokens, Geist/Geist Mono, hierarchy, and a11y (axe: 0 violations) match. Notes for P09: cards should pair the hairline border with `--shadow-sm` like the prototype; the eyebrow repeats the h1; the lede's em dash wraps; `/favicon.ico` 404s and the dev badge shows in the acceptance screenshot; `-webkit-text-size-adjust` missing; `--font-mono` ends in a doubled `monospace`. Reviewer adds: the font remap in `globals.css` must also cover `[data-theme="dark"]`.

**Action taken:** Carried into the P09-A implementer prompt.

## 2026-09-22 — eve init behaviour to control in P02 [DRIFT]

**Iter:** 001
**Source:** peer-review
**Severity:** medium

**Charter / context:** Reviewer read eve@0.63.0's init code while checking the runner placeholder.
**Verdict text / failure detail:** With `runner/package.json` present, `npx eve@0.63.0 init .` adds to the existing project instead of a fresh scaffold. Init defaults `typescript` to 7.0.2 (root pins 6.0.3), writes `"eve": "^0.63.0"` with a caret, edits workspace root files, and installs with `autoApprove` and `bypassMinimumReleaseAge` on.

**Action taken:** Carried into the P02 spike and skeleton prompts: pin `eve` exactly, keep TypeScript 6.0.3, review every root-file edit init makes, keep pnpm's release-age policy.

## 2026-09-22 — Owner's local path in the public spec [DRIFT]

**Iter:** 001
**Source:** peer-review
**Severity:** low

**Charter / context:** The repo is public; `docs/spec/map.md:16` held `/Users/<owner>/.agents/...`.
**Verdict text / failure detail:** A local username in a public file. `check:fixtures` cannot catch paths.

**Action taken:** Orchestrator replaced it with a non-identifying reference in the iter-001 commit. History is unchanged (no force-push).

## 2026-09-22 — Low-severity follow-ups from P00 review [DRIFT]

**Iter:** 001
**Source:** peer-review
**Severity:** low

**Charter / context:** Not blocking; for a later CI or config touch.
**Verdict text / failure detail:** (a) `actions/*@v4` warn that their Node 20 runtime is deprecated. (b) Owner call: set `minimumReleaseAgeStrict: true` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so pnpm cannot silently add release-age exceptions.

**Action taken:** Logged; (a) goes to the next packet that edits `.github/`, (b) listed under Open owner decisions in the integration PR.
